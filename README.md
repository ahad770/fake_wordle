This project is based upon the popular New York Times Puzzle: Wordle. The premise of the game is the player gets 6 guess to choose a randomly generated 5 letter word. After each guess, the game will update which letters are in the word or not. The main problem with Wordle is only 1 puzzle is generated a day. Fake Wordle is looking to scratch that word puzzle itch. Use it to practice for Wordle, or just relax and enjoy!
